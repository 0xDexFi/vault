# VAULT - Claude Code Rules

## Workflow Rules

1. **NEVER edit code without explicit user permission.** Always present the issue first, explain the proposed fix, and wait for approval before making any changes.
2. Read and understand files before suggesting modifications.
3. Present issues clearly with file paths and line numbers.
4. One issue at a time — get confirmation, then proceed.
